## Course Objectives
#### About Myself:
- Studied Computer Science and Math at Ashoka University
- Originally from Bombay
- I've always been fascinated with the idea of being an inventor and pioneer of sciences but have the attention span of a goldfish due to the collective brain rot. Have no clue about what I want to do except that Im good with numbers and mathematical thinking, and coding seems like magic to me. Hence I'm siding towards a career in data science and AI.
#### What I want from the course
- Honestly I just wanna get employed
- However I also want to build interesting projects that not just look good on my CV but also get me kickstarted into the field of data science. Basically anything that makes me an expert in the field
- I liked this course particularly cause it is not very spoon-feedy, has a perfect mix of self learning and tutorials and honestly it's free. But all other courses seemed commercial and lacked actual projects that we had to build on our own.
- But seriously I really need to get employed
- Since im not sure between academia and corporate so this hopefully also gives me perfect exposure for both

## List of interesting Kaggle Datasets
- I don't particularly like a Kaggle dataset yet but I've been working on scraping scorecard data for all test matches in cricket. I want to use that data for multiple analytical pieces - comparing batsmen across different generations, creating a universal timeless ranking system, testing a hypothesis like the left right batting advantage,etc.
- I am particularly interested in computer vision datasets, especially a dataset in the medical industry such as cancer or brain tumours for example.
